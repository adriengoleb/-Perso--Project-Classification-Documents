# Project-Classification-Documents

Project to **automatically classify these official documents into 5 social categories (pay slip, property tax notice, tax, account statement)** using Machine Learning techniques. This project allowed me to apply all the essential steps to a prediction process: data cleaning, data preparation, Features Engineering, Learning Strategy, learning and choice of prediction metrics. It was also the opportunity to discover techniques of transformation of raw textual data (Bag Of Words method) and to parameterize for the first time learning algorithms (parameter tuning). 

This **first personal project in Machine Learning**, realized during my 2nd year of school, was a real opportunity to implement from start to finish an ML oriented strategy on data. This project was a real discovery.
